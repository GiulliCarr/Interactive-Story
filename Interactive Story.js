Especially when you’re a teenager on the cusp of adulthood, you’re constantly told, “You have your whole life ahead of you, how exciting!” and, “Oh we can’t wait to see what you make of yourself.” But is it really that straightforward? Choosing a path in life, putting nothing but trust in your decision, and tada, happily ever after? This is only scratching the surface when it comes to the inner workings of Ana’s mind; an eighteen-year-old high school senior, coming to a daunting crossroads in life. A girl with love and talent in art, a long-term boyfriend with his own set of plans, and a family who may adore her but have their own opinions on her future, Ana has become the unfortunate holder of potential opportunities, ones that can either bring her a life of pleasantries, or trial after trial..","\n","ev","str","^Let’s Begin","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"start_story"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"start_story":[["^You wake up to the sound of your alarm blaring.

You check your phone. 5 missed calls from Nate and a text reading \"I’ll leave without you\"!","\n","^You roll your eyes and let out a small sigh as you head out the front door. You and Nate have been dating since the beginning of high school, having been friends since elementary school. Where you have been known to be a dreamer, Nate is practical, maybe even old-fashioned with his way of thinking, always talking about how you two will be married when HE finishes college, and HE has a full-time career.","\n","^You’ve chosen not to really think about it too deeply, but lately, life has been forcing you to confront the uncomfortable.","\n","^As you walk out the door, you’re greeted by Nate and his truck, impatiently honking the horn as you open the passenger door.","\n","^Nate: \"What the hell took you so long?!

The only difference? A piece of paper you were handed in AP English, with a fill-in prompt about what university you will be attending and your major. This is a topic that you have been actively avoiding like the plague.","\n","^You’ve been accepted to an out-of-state school with a budding pre-med program, and a liberal arts college in the Bay Area, just 5 hours from your hometown that boasts a reputable arts and design program.","\n","^On one hand, you’ve always had a knack for science, particularly biology, and know that if you went into pre-med you’d make your parents happy.
